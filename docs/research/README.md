# Research

This folder collects open research questions, investigations, and exploratory ideas about Zenon’s design.

This includes:

- Browser-native light client feasibility
- libp2p and WebRTC transport research
- Proof-serving and Sentry mechanics
- Deterministic execution models
- Cryptographic design patterns
- Scalability considerations
- Role of extension chains vs native features

Research here is exploratory, not authoritative. The goal is curiosity and clarity.
