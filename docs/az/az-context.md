AZ Context — Why Governance Is Referenced in This Repository

Status: Context note
Purpose: Explain why on-chain governance appears in a research repository
Non-goal: This document does not advocate approval, funding, or implementation

1. Why AZ Is Referenced at All

The presence of an AZ proposal in this repository is intentional, but narrow in scope.

The goal is not to market an idea, seek endorsement, or imply technical readiness.
The goal is to make research activity legible to the system it exists within.

In Zenon, governance is one of the few mechanisms that provides:
	•	a durable, public timestamp
	•	an unambiguous author or submitter
	•	a canonical reference that persists outside chat platforms or forums

For research that is exploratory, boundary-driven, and explicitly non-normative, this matters more than promotion.

2. Research Visibility vs. Research Advocacy

This repository treats governance as a registry, not a decision engine.

Submitting a research proposal on-chain does not mean:
	•	the ideas are correct
	•	the ideas should be implemented
	•	the ideas represent Zenon’s roadmap
	•	the ideas are endorsed by the community or pillars

It only means:

“This body of work exists, has an identifiable author, and is open to public evaluation.”

Approval or rejection are both valid outcomes.

3. Discoverability and the Taxonomy Problem

A recurring issue encountered during this research was misclassification.

When ideas are:
	•	scattered across Telegram, Discord, GitHub comments, and old posts
	•	unnamed or inconsistently described
	•	not indexed outside closed communities

They are often misunderstood or dismissed before being read.

Modern research discovery increasingly happens via:
	•	search engines
	•	crawlers
	•	LLM-based analysis
	•	cross-repository comparison

Anchoring research to a public, indexed governance artifact helps prevent it from being:
	•	misbucketed as marketing
	•	mistaken for implementation claims
	•	lost to platform churn

This is a practical concern, not a philosophical one.

4. Why This Is Not “Marketing”

Marketing optimizes for persuasion.
Research optimizes for falsifiability.

This repository intentionally includes:
	•	explicit non-guarantees
	•	hostile reviews
	•	impossibility boundaries
	•	prohibited use cases

Those are not marketing behaviors.

The AZ reference exists to make the research traceable, not attractive.

5. Relationship to the Research Documents

The AZ proposal covers:
	•	header-only verification
	•	bounded inclusion
	•	minimal state frontier verification
	•	associated critiques and boundary specifications

It does not:
	•	prioritize one document over another
	•	define sequencing or timelines
	•	imply dependency between research and funding

The research stands on its own.
The proposal simply makes its existence explicit to governance.

6. What Readers Should Infer (and Not Infer)

Readers may infer:
	•	the work is exploratory
	•	the work is open to critique
	•	the work is intentionally scoped and limited
	•	the work is community-visible

Readers should not infer:
	•	technical endorsement
	•	economic guarantees
	•	roadmap commitments
	•	exclusivity or ownership claims

7. Summary

This repository references AZ because governance is one of the few places where research can be:
	•	publicly anchored
	•	time-stamped
	•	attributed
	•	evaluated without intermediaries

That visibility serves researchers, reviewers, and future builders — regardless of whether the work is ultimately adopted, rejected, or ignored.
